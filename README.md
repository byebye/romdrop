### ROMDROP
Minimalist Flash Toolkit for the 2006-2015 Mazda MX-5 (NC).

### Requirements:
* Tactrix Openport 2.0 J2534 Device
* Windows 10 (probably works with older versions, but untested)
* NC1/NC2/NC3 Mazda Miata

### How To Download:
* select the green button labeled "clone or download" to the upper right
* select "Download ZIP" from the drop down menu

### Install:
* unzip the romdrop archive to desired location
* license agreement MUST remain in the same folder as the executable

### Application Files:
* romdrop_license.txt - end user license agreement
* romdrop.exe - application executable
* romdrop.crc - checksum data for stock calibrations and patches 
* colormaps (folder) - preferred ecuflash color map files
* logcgfs (folder) - logging configurations for the tactrix
* metadata (folder) - all ecuflash definitions that are currently available
* patches (folder) - available patch files for ROMs currently defined

### Application Files (generated):
* romdrop.log - all loggable activity
* romdrop.rda - last calibration succesful flashed 
* candump.raw - up to 2MB of binary data sniffed off the canbus (see menu item below)

### Usage:
* connect openport into available USB slot
* connect openport to vehicle OBD port 
* double click romdrop.exe to execute from windows
* or execute from command line: romdrop.exe <filename.ext>

BTW you can associate a rom's file extension (typically .bin) with romdrop, afterwhich, you'll only need to double-click the rom you want to flash. Romdrop will automatically attempt to "dynamic" (quick) flash that file to the ECU... no menus, no keypresses, no nothing.

Itâ€™s advised that you do not simultaneously run applications that consume heavy resources while flashing.

### Menu Items:
* C | Clear Diagnostic Trouble Codes - self explanatory.
* D | Dynamic Flash ROM - References last succesful flash, and updates ROM blocks that have changed.
* F | Flash Entire ROM - Flashes all ROM blocks to the ECU.
* P | Patch Stock ROM - Many functions accessable by romdrop require that the factory calibration be patched with updated code. Use this option to apply the patch file to your stock ROM, and generate a newly patched calibration for editing with ecuflash.
* R | Read ROM from ECU - this is the first thing you should do if virgin to the application. Why? **You will always want a backup of your original stock rom, and it's required to apply feature patches.**
* S | Sniff CAN Communications - the app can log 2MB of raw CAN communications. This is for the hacker types.
* V | Version for ROM - display ROM patch version
* Q | Quit - Exit application

### Patches:
What are romdrop patches? In order to create a calibration for use with both romdrop and ecuflash, you must first patch your factory rom with a matching '&lt;calibration-id&gt;.patch' file. Don't fret, the process is drag and drop.

* Identify your calibration-id
* Download associated patch (or look in patches directory)
* Launch romdrop
* Select 'P'atch from main menu
* Drag and drop factory rom when prompted
* Drag and drop patch when prompted
* Romdrop will create a newly patched binary

_Note: If no '.patch' can be found for your calibration-id, a definition for your ROM does not exist. Use Romdrop to 'R'ead your factory calibration, then submit a link to the binary for processing. Once processed, a definition (&lt;calibration-id&gt;.xml) and patch (&lt;calibration-id&gt;.patch) will be added to the 'romdrop' and 'romdrop-patches' repositories respectively._

### ECUFlash Setup:
* download and install ecuflash
* navigate to file>options>Directories>Metadata Directory, and set location to romdrop's metadata folder
* navigate to file>options>Directories>Color Map Directory, and set location to romdrop's colomaps fodlder 
* quit and relaunch ecuflash for changes to take effect
